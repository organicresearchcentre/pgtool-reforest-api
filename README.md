# Public Goods Tool
## Background
The PG Tool was built to allow researchers and land managers alike to easily identify the public
goods that are being created on their land through data collected under various indicators. The
tool was also built with flexibility and adaptability in mind, with numerous custom versions being
built over the years to address specific research interests.

This REFOREST version of the PG Tool was developed by [Organic Research Centre](https://www.organicresearchcentre.com) and [University of Reading](https://www.reading.ac.uk/), based on an [original version](https://github.com/organicresearchcentre/pgtool-api) of the online PG Tool. The tool offers an interface that increases accessibility for farmers, advisors and researchers to interact and learn with it.

You can access the REFOREST version of the PG Tool at the [REFOREST website toolbox](https://reforest.euromed-economists.org/).

A [user guide for self-assessments](https://github.com/organicresearchcentre/pgtool-reforest-gui/blob/main/PG%20Tool%20Online%20v3.1%20Manual.md) has also been created for the REFOREST version of PG Tool.

For developers there is [further infromation](https://github.com/organicresearchcentre/pgtool-gui/blob/main/PG%20Tool%20Online%20Development.md) about the design and future development of the PG Tool.
